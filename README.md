# Mower Control

Code to control an automated mower using Raspberry Pi, GPS, and Xbox controller.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an autonomous lawn mower controlled using an Xbox One controller. The system integrates GPS data handling, motor control, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for monitoring and controlling the mower.

### Main Components and Functionalities

1. **Libraries and Constants**:
   - Libraries: 
     - `pygame`: For Xbox controller input handling.
     - `serial`: For serial communication with GPS and motor controller.
     - `RPi.GPIO`: For controlling GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.
     - Standard Python libraries: `time`, `logging`, `traceback`, `json`, `os`, `threading`, `tkinter`, `simpledialog`, `messagebox`.
     - `pynmea2`: For parsing GPS data.
   - Constants:
     - `SERVO_PIN`: GPIO pin for servo control.
     - `BACKUP_DISTANCE`: Distance to move backward in feet.
     - `GPS_SERIAL_PORT`: Serial port for GPS data.
     - `MOTOR_SERIAL_PORT`: Serial port for motor controller.
     - `SERVO_ON`: Duty cycle to turn on the servo.
     - `SERVO_OFF`: Duty cycle to turn off the servo.
     - `EMERGENCY_STOP_BUTTON`: Xbox controller button for emergency stop.
     - `LOG_FILE`: Log file for GPS data.
     - `GRID_SIZE`: Size of the grid for mapping.

2. **Logging Setup**:
   - Records GPS data and debug information to a log file (`gps_data.log`).

3. **GPIO Initialization**:
   - Sets up GPIO pins and PWM signal for the servo motor control.

4. **Xbox Controller Initialization**:
   - Uses `pygame` to initialize the Xbox controller and handle its inputs.

5. **Serial Port Initialization**:
   - Functions (`init_serial`) to initialize serial connections for the GPS and motor controller.

6. **Mapping and State Variables**:
   - Variables for mapping mode, obstacle mode, current GPS position, and a grid representing the mapped area.
   - The grid is a 2D list representing the lawn, with each cell indicating a path or obstacle.

7. **Grid Data Management**:
   - Functions to load (`load_grid`) and save (`save_grid`) grid data from/to a JSON file.

8. **GUI Setup**:
   - A `tkinter` based GUI displays GPS coordinates, motor status, signal quality, and interacts with the grid data.
   - Includes labels for displaying information, a canvas for the grid, and buttons for saving and loading the grid.

9. **Motor Control**:
   - Functions to update motor control based on joystick inputs and handle emergency stops.

10. **GPS Data Handling**:
   - Functions to read and parse GPS data from the serial port and update the current position and signal quality.

11. **Main Loop**:
   - Continuously checks for controller inputs, updates motor control, reads GPS data, and updates the GUI.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS installed.
- Xbox One controller.
- GPS module.
- Motor controller and motors.
- Python 3 installed on the Raspberry Pi.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/tylers2015/mower_control.git
   cd mower_control

    Install Required Packages:

    sh

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3-pygame python3-rpi.gpio bluetooth bluez blueman

Running the Script

    Execute the Script:

    sh

    python3 src/mower_control.py

    Observe the Console and GUI:
        Confirm that the motors respond to controller inputs and the GPS data is being updated correctly.

Troubleshooting

    Connection Issues:
        Ensure the Xbox controller is in pairing mode.
        Verify that the Raspberry Piâ€™s Bluetooth is active and functional.
        Restart the Bluetooth service if needed:

        sh

        sudo systemctl restart bluetooth

Connecting the Xbox One Controller via Bluetooth

    Turn on the Xbox One Controller:
        Press the Xbox button to turn it on.
        Put it in pairing mode by holding the sync button until the Xbox button flashes rapidly.

    Pair the Controller with Raspberry Pi:
        Open a terminal and use the bluetoothctl tool:

        sh

bluetoothctl

In the bluetoothctl prompt, enter the following commands:

sh

agent on
default-agent
scan on

Wait for the controller to appear in the list, then note its MAC address. Pair with it using:

sh

        pair <MAC_ADDRESS>
        trust <MAC_ADDRESS>
        connect <MAC_ADDRESS>

    Verify the Connection:
        Ensure that the controller is connected. You should see confirmation messages indicating a successful connection.

Setting Up SSH Key for GitHub

    Generate SSH Key:

    sh

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

Follow the prompts to save the key (press Enter to accept the default location) and set a passphrase if desired.

Add Your SSH Key to the ssh-agent:

sh

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

Copy Your SSH Key to the Clipboard:

sh

cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Copy the output of this command.

Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account:

    Go to GitHub SSH keys settings.
    Click "New SSH key".
    Paste the copied SSH key into the "Key" field.
    Add a descriptive title.
    Click "Add SSH key".

Change the Remote URL to Use SSH:

sh

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:tylers2015/mower_control.git

Push the test Branch to the Remote Repository:

sh

    git push origin test
